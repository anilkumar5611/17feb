    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL, document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON), allowing for the representation of complex hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases: Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases), NoSQL databases don't rely on a fixed schema, making them more flexible and scalable. They are suitable for scenarios where data is constantly evolving, and the volume of data is large and distributed.\n",
